Data Science and Openshift on the MOC Proposal
--------------------------------------------------

Vision and Goals
--------------------

-   Deploy DataHub, a cloud-native data science platform, on Openshift, a
    container orchestration platform by RedHat, while running on the MOC.

-   Deploy and extend the existing anomaly detection application, Prometheus, to
    analyze time-series data generated by cloud infrastructure and send alerts
    for potential anomalies.

Users/Personas
------------------

-   Data Scientists that would like to use Datahub on the MOC

-   Site Reliability Engineers that would like to monitor the health of their
    applications

Scope and Features
----------------------

-   Availability of DataHub on the MOC which runs on Openshift

-   Extension of the current Prometheus Anomaly Detection tool with new models

Solution Concept
--------------------

-   The solution will comprise of a Prometheus deployment running on OpenShift
    in conjunction with Data Hub.

-   The system will utilize machine learning models to analyze time-series data
    about CPU usage and other parameters, provided by Data Hub, and identify
    patterns in the data.

-   Itâ€™ll send out alerts to SREs and other stakeholders if it detects an
    anomaly in the parameters.

Acceptance Criteria
-----------------------

Have Data Hub up and running on Openshift and add at least one working model on
Prometheus.
