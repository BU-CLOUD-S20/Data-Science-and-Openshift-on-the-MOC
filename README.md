**Data Science and Openshift on the MOC Proposal**
--------------------------------------------------

**Metors**
----------

-   Michael Clifford, RedHat Inc.
-   Anand Sanmukhani, RedHat Inc.

**TEAM**
--------

-   Yousif Khaireddin
-   Zhuofa (Marco) Chen
-   Krishna Palle
-   Fangya Xu
-   Nihar Dwivedi
-   Ojasvi Jhamb

**Goals**
---------

-   Deploying [Prometheus Anomaly Detection
    (PAD)](https://github.com/AICoE/prometheus-anomaly-detector), an
    existing open-source project developed by the AI team at RedHat to
    analyze time-series data generated by cloud infrastructure, onto
    [DataHub](http://opendatahub.io/), a blueprint for building an AI
    application as a service platform on the [OpenShift Container
    Platform](https://www.openshift.com/).

-   Understanding and building machine learning models to extend
    Prometheus Anomaly Detection (PAD).

**Users/Personas**
------------------

-   The open-source community

-   MOC users that want to analyze time-series data generated by cloud
    infrastructure and send alerts for potential anomalies

-   Site Reliability Engineers that would like to monitor the health of
    their applications

**Scope and Features**
----------------------

-   Ensuring the deployment and functionality of DataHub on the MOC

-   Extension of the current Prometheus Anomaly Detection tool with a
    new model(s)

-   Exploring/reporting any issues and bugs we encounter along with the
    project for future ramifications

**Solution Concept**
--------------------

-   Installing OpenShift client datahub on our local development
    environments to get comfortable with them

-   Developing and testing PAD ML algorithms on JupiterHub

-   Deploying these models onto the DataHub running on the MOC

**Acceptance Criteria**
-----------------------

Ensuring that PAD is deployed onto DataHub with at least one new ML
model.

**Release Planning**
--------------------

1.  Project familiarization (02/05)
